      "    =======================\n",

      "            >>> import pdb\n",
      "            >>> pdb.run('<a statement>')\n",
      "    \n",
      "    The debugger's prompt is '(Pdb) '.  This will stop in the first\n",
      "    function call in <a statement>.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Alternatively, if a statement terminated with an unhandled exception,\n",
      "    you can use pdb's post-mortem facility to inspect the contents of the\n",
      "    traceback:\n",
      "    \n",
      "            >>> <a statement>\n",
      "            <exception traceback>\n",
      "            >>> import pdb\n",
      "            >>> pdb.pm()\n",
      "    \n",
      "    The commands recognized by the debugger are listed in the next\n",
      "    section.  Most can be abbreviated as indicated; e.g., h(elp) means\n",
      "    that 'help' can be typed as 'h' or 'help' (but not as 'he' or 'hel',\n",
      "    nor as 'H' or 'Help' or 'HELP').  Optional arguments are enclosed in\n",
      "    square brackets.  Alternatives in the command syntax are separated\n",
      "    by a vertical bar (|).\n",
      "    \n",
      "    A blank line repeats the previous command literally, except for\n",
      "    'list', where it lists the next 11 lines.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Commands that the debugger doesn't recognize are assumed to be Python\n",
      "    statements and are executed in the context of the program being\n",
      "    debugged.  Python statements can also be prefixed with an exclamation\n",
      "    point ('!').  This is a powerful way to inspect the program being\n",
      "    debugged; it is even possible to change variables or call functions.\n",
      "    When an exception occurs in such a statement, the exception name is\n",
      "    printed but the debugger's state is not changed.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    The debugger supports aliases, which can save typing.  And aliases can\n",
      "    have parameters (see the alias help entry) which allows one a certain\n",
      "    level of adaptability to the context under examination.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Multiple commands may be entered on a single line, separated by the\n",
      "    pair ';;'.  No intelligence is applied to separating the commands; the\n",
      "    input is split at the first ';;', even if it is in the middle of a\n",
      "    quoted string.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    If a file \".pdbrc\" exists in your home directory or in the current\n",
      "    directory, it is read in and executed as if it had been typed at the\n",
      "    debugger prompt.  This is particularly useful for aliases.  If both\n",
      "    files exist, the one in the home directory is read first and aliases\n",
      "    defined there can be overridden by the local file.  This behavior can be\n",
      "    disabled by passing the \"readrc=False\" argument to the Pdb constructor.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Aside from aliases, the debugger is not directly programmable; but it\n",
      "    is implemented as a class from which you can derive your own debugger\n",
      "    class, which you can make as fancy as you like.\n",
